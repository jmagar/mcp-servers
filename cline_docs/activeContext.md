# Active Context

## Current Task
- Setting up the repository structure for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers
- Adding multiple MCP server implementations to the project
- Managing server files directly in the project root

## Recent Changes
- Created a comprehensive .gitignore file for Python and TypeScript projects
- Added the following MCP servers as Git submodules:
  - mcp-server-qdrant: Vector database for semantic memory storage
  - mcp-server-docker: Docker container operations
  - mcp-server-firecrawl: Firecrawl MCP server
  - searxng-mcp-server: SearXNG metasearch engine integration
- Added several MCP servers directly to the project root:
  - github: For GitHub API integration
  - git: For Git operations
  - brave-search: For Brave Search engine integration
  - fetch: For HTTP request capabilities
  - filesystem: For local filesystem operations
  - sequentialthinking: For step-by-step reasoning
  - time: For date and time utilities
- Updated README.md to reflect the new repository structure
- Created a setup script (setup-mcp-servers.sh) for importing MCP servers

## Next Steps
- Configure individual MCP servers as needed
- Set up example usage and documentation
- Potentially add more MCP servers as required
- Implement standardized configuration approaches across servers
